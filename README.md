# Arduino-Terrarium-System
Problem Statement - 
You just bought a beautiful terrarium for the house. You were advised to keep the terrarium in
sunlight for an average of 2 hours a day. You aim to build an embedded device that uses the
Arduino device to measure the amount of sunlight exposure your terrarium has. You plan to
use the IFTTT service which will provide you with a notification throughout the day when the
sunlight hits your terrarium and another notification when it stops. The sunlight information is
to be provided by your Arduino device. You can use any notification mechanism that is
supported by IFTTT (mobile notification, email etc). </br>
